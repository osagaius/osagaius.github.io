## It's All Good
Thanks to my family and friends for the outpouring of love at the inaugural moment of my twenty-fifth year.

Here are a few of the failures from my twenty-fourth year: got laid off from a great company; gained 20 (or 30) pounds; neglected visiting or calling family and friends regularly; hurt a loved one deeply; abruptly abandoned a project; watched too much Netflix; ignored my mental and physical health; and wrote too little.

In the midst of these failures though, I accomplished things that I am proud of: got another job working with my hero and a great team; went to DisneyWorld with a loved one; gave several tech talks; gained 5 pounds of muscle; moved to Atlanta; reunited with old aunts and uncles; watched a lot of Netflix; and learned to love myself a little more.

In my twenty-fifth year, the aim is to operationalize last year's failures â€” to learn from them and act against them. More generally, the focus is to be deliberate in three areas: health, relationships, and work. I aim to travel more regularly, and write more to nourish my soul. Most of all, I hope to learn to forgive and accept, in myself and others, the various shortcomings that define our humanity.
